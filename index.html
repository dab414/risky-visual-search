	<h3>Thanks for piloting my study!</h3>
	<p>Some important info:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Please try to complete this before Thursday of this week (2/17)</li>
		<li>It should hopefully take you around 30 min to complete (although timing is one of the things I'm testing with this pilot).</li>
		<li>At the end of the study there will be a large text box asking you a specific question. Ignore the question and simply leave notes about whether anything seemed weird in the experiment (like a bug I need to fix). </li>
		<li>If something crashes before you get to the end, please send me an email with as much detail as possible about what happened (dab414@lehigh.edu).</li>
		<li>The experiment must be completed from a computer that has a keyboard (ie, no cell phones or tablets). </li>
		<li>At the end of the study, when you press "Submit", you'll be redirected to the SONA login screen and will receive an error. That's expected, it's not a problem.</li>

	<p>Thanks again! Click <a href='https://davebraun.net/gaita/production/exp1?id=test_id'>here</a> to begin.</p>
