	<h3>Pilot for Dave</h3>
	<p>Thanks for piloting my study! A few things to note:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If possible, please try to complete earlier in the week rather than later.</li>
		<li>I'm hoping for this to take you about 30 mins, but timing is something I'm piloting for.</li>
		<li>At the end of the study there will be a large text box asking you a specific question. Ignore the question and simply leave notes about whether anything seemed weird in the experiment (like a bug I need to fix).</li>
		<li>If something crashes before you get to the end, please send me an email with as much detail as possible about what happened (dab414@lehigh.edu).</li>
		<li>The experiment must be completed from a computer that has a keyboard (ie, no cell phones or tablets). </li>
		<li>When you click the final 'Submit' button at the end, you will be redirected to SONA and see an error. That's expected- not a problem.</li>
