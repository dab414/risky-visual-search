follow ups to dissertation stuff

	experiment where i move the actual reference point
		would prob need to be between subjects
		anchor low vs. anchor high

		think about what else might be impacted by seeing repeated effort prospects as gains vs losses

	change the effortful task

	maybe investigate more on how reward is processed during effort decisions
		especially going into the effort involved in calculating the EVC essentially

	just undertake the exercise of generating possible explanations for why the effect is backwards and put them to the test
		yea all the explanations from the og document are pretty trash

	is there something about their performance across cued trials that i think might impact choice?

	use relative framing but just with number of switches vs. number of repetitions
		rules out any explanations having to do with that it's something about the effort units or their exaggerated scale


possible explanations
	
	keeping in mind the evidence from the new study that this effect might be the result of learning

	the jessecae explanation
		once people experience the effort, they become accepting of the moderate amount of effort
		not much disutility attached to the reference level of effort in gain framing, so they're biased to go for the gamble
		might be much aversion to hardest possible outcome, leading them to prefer a moderately more difficult amount of effort vs. risk the hardest possible effort

		tricky bc easiest risky (hard) outcome is only one switch more than hardest (hard) safe outcome
			if this explanation is true, it might be being influenced by the exaggerated scale of the effort units
			although doesn't quite explain why the effect seems to be learned

	control mode explanation
		the number of switches performed on the previous trial might impact risk preference in the current trial
		looking at the plots, it certainly seems like there might be some evidence for this
		eg, ppl are much more willing to accept risk of extremely hard when they have just done extremely hard (max switches) on prev trial

		after looking more at the data, i don't think this one is supported based on what im seeing
			it just looks like ppl who align with the overall trend on trial t-1 also align with also align with it on trial t
				rather than risk preferences really having much to do with number of switches performed per se

	try to relate it back to evc
		see notes in notebook
		keep going with this one

	dumb explanations
		it's bc of the colors
		it's bc of the +/- signs


questions

	will it extend to types of effort beyond cognitive control?
		other tasks:
			memory load
			searching visual array
			math problems
			reading comprehension
			the apps task, shifts in visual attention
			n back
	is it more about wanting to save effort or time?
		manipulating the size of some visual search array will have a huge impact on time
		can keep time constant and see if the effect still shows up
			might undermine their motivation, but something like accurate performance will have to do less blocks or whatever

	what about the evidence of learning effects in the data that i have?
		take the rapid fire approach and test that separately
		counterbalance it with the traditional performance


go with visual search
manipulate time vs. effort
