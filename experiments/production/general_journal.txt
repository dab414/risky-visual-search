	noticing that safe_deck_outcome is coming in with NAs
		looks like it's for easier than reference condition

		fixed

	looks like there is phase_runtime_mins already in there

	think it's ready to go
		just gotta push it all up when im ready to launch
		cut off the pilot link

2-15-2022
	pilot underway
	things im seeing in the data thus far:
		phase_run_time has no units
	totalTime_mins coming in as null in demo
	do something about choice_rt and searchRt
	include search response key

	think it's pretty much ready except for instructions for dst
	gonna make a new video

	maybe put instructions for RAs on the ./pilot landing page
	include what i sent to jessecae and heads up that they'll end by going back to sona and seeing an error

	assigning the + sign to outcomes got unbelievably difficult
		think of an easier way
	error feedback isnt working

	working through the decks portion of the experiment
	revamping old code for new purposes is a bit of a mess
	the js in the main html doc i think is mostly in place
	but ill need to go carefully through the individual js functions and make sure we're processing number of distractors rather than number of switches
	the global_js vs exp js distinction is starting to become a mess

2-4-2022
	what's the target resolution?
	maybe

2-3-2022
	starting the process of demolition first
	there's a lot i can drop from the dissertation code

	biggest challenge will prob be setting up the array and dynamically drawing distractors / targets on the fly
	keep in mind some type of html-generating code...

	too low energy for all this today
